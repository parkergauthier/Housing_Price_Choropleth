This application (above) is a collection of Python Scripts myself and my colleagues have made to visualize trends in the US real estate market. The pricing information was gathered from data made publicly available from Zillow, and the population information was gathered from the US census. These data sets were cleaned and merged to compute percentage changes (both year-on-year and aggregated for the decade) at the state and county level (done mostly with base Python and Pandas). Then using Plotly, we visualized these trends using choropleth maps. Finally, we turned these Python scripts into a webapp using Dash, and hosted them using Heroku to display on this Github Pages site.  
Due to a substantial missing data problem, some of the aggregated state percentage change data is overinflated. Reaching all the way back to 2010, Zillow's records of house prices at the county level is somewhat limited, especially for counties with lower population/real estate activity, or ones who were unlikely to use Zillow as a service. The formula we chose for calculating our averages was geared towards preserving accuracy in regions of high real estate activity on a county level. So large, high traffic markets like LA County (CA), Harris County (TX), or Kings County (NY) are represented accurately. When aggregating at the state level, we chose to population-weight our county level estimates, rather than simply than taking a simple average of median house price. These two decisions in concert with data being missing in the early parts of our data set for low-traffic counties mean that in some extreme cases (like Mississippi) almost half the counties only have entries for the last few years of the data set. Since 2015 especially, services like Zillow have become standard practice for real estate transactions, so this methodology should be broadly applicable to any data generated going forward.  
*(The choropleths, especially the median house price ones, do take a while to load as they have to render a lot of data using the relatively low-load system provided to us by Heroku. The app runs slightly faster [on its own](https://house-price-choro.herokuapp.com/) if you'd like to see for yourself, though as always there are limitations when using a free hosting service.)*  

This project was primarily an exercise in data engineering and visualization. The full project, as well as steps to recreate it can be found in [the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/amal-kadri/Housing_Price_Choropleth_app), or using the button at the top of the page!

**At the time of making this website (04/18/2022) Heroku's Integration with GitHub was not functioning properly, so the app was published manually through the Heroku CLI. This should hopefully not be an issue going forward, and we recommend using GitHub version control for collaboration going forward. This is only an issue with the webapp hosting, and not with the core functionality of the apps themselves or the underlying code.*
